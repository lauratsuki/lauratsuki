<h1>how to interact with me properly on ponytown</h1>

PLEASE PLEASE PRETTY PLEASE <b><i>DO NOT COPY MY SKINS UNLESS I GIVE YOU PERMISSION</i></b>. i really want to make my skins look nice and unique and also that my oomfs can identify me on pt easily

usually i interact with anybody that does not clarify their interaction status, if you <i>DO</i> have an interaction status with you (dniuid, iwc, fti, and the like) then i will follow those statuses appropiately.

if i know you and you are a friend of mine, then you may <b><i>cuddle and hide</i></b> freely. i also tend to ask others if i can cuddle/hide as well.

<i>please consider</i> using tonetags on me, since i tend to misinterpret tones <i>for some reason</i>. i also tend to use tonetags myself as well, just in case others need them to communicate properly.

also consider seeing my interact/dni list on my strawpage <a href=https://lauralitezz.straw.page/interaction>/here'</a>

i have a typing quirk that swaps places with `'` and `!`, so there!s not much need of a translation unless you have a screenreader on for obvious reasons.

i tend to make cosplays of characters from small/dead/niche fandoms, so if you do not know who my cosplay is, feel free to ask' ^^ this is also why i never show some cosplays in public because i get afraid that people might not know who my cosplay is supposed to be.
